Interstellar emission

Fermi bubbles: map as in DC-1, low threshold such that only emission at |b|< 6 preserved. Spectrum from Herold and Malyshev 2019

GC ridge: map from HESS 2006, cut at 270 and pixel X > 452. Spectrum from HESS  2016

The GC ridge model has to be used with the baseline IEM to model the GC ridge, but it has to be removed when using the gamma model.
